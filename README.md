a beginner friendly simple apps that create tones or sounds by Clojure

#### current status - ** under construction as of May 22, 2015 **
This overtone app is on the way to become a part of ClojureBridge curriculum.
It is a nice, fun app worth trying out even right now.
However, a document has gaps for beginners and, sometime, may not be easy to follow for beginners.
If your students have some exepriences on Clojure or other languages, this app may be a good one to tackle after the drawing app.
